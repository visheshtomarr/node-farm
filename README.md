# Node Farm

Node Farm is a simple Node.js project that serves a farm products catalog using a basic HTTP server. It reads product data from a JSON file, generates dynamic HTML pages, and allows users to navigate between an overview page and individual product pages.

## Features

- Serves a dynamic product catalog using Node.js.
- Generates HTML content dynamically from JSON data.
- Uses URL slugs for product pages.
- Provides an API endpoint to fetch product data in JSON format.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1.  Clone the repository or copy the project files.
2.  Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

This will start a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Available Routes
